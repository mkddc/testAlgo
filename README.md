## Guidelines

- solve the levels in ascending order
- commit your code at least at the end of each level

## What we expect

- clean code
- tests
- comments when you had to make decisions because the spec was not precise enough
- a simple way to run the code and the tests

## Acknowledgements

This test a shameless copy from an e-commerce tech-interview, that I found really great :)
