# Level 3

Some products are on discount because the marketing department made a deal with the supplier.

There are two kinds of discounts:
- a direct reduction of the article's price, e.g. you remove 50€ from your 300€ caviar tin and pay only 250€
- a percentage reduction, e.g. you remove 20% from your 5€ fresh cream and pay only 4€
